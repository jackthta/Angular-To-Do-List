# Daily Task Manager (Angular 7)
This is a simple daily task managing, single page application. This project was built using Angular 7, Firebase's Realtime Database, and Bootstrap 4. Angular routing was used to traverse different pages. Firebase's Authentication was used to allow for user authentication and authorization (via authorization guard). Functionality includes adding tasks, checking them to complete them, and deleting them. Deleting checked (finished) tasks will move them to your own task history traversable through the navigation bar. You can then delete them from the task history if need be. Deleting unchecked (unfinished) tasks will just delete them.
